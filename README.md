# Resume

**UPDATE:** Because the JSONResume ecosystem and project has and is slowly dying, this repository will not be maintained further.
This is NOT my most up-to-date resume.

Resume in the JSONResume format. Will be migrating to this for everything.

## Setup

1. Install JSONResume: `npm install -g resume-cli`
2. Install the theme of choice: `npm install -g jsonresume-theme-[theme]`
3. Export: `resume export [--theme THEME] resume.[pdf|html]
